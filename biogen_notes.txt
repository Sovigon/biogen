Make the grid 1 dimensional, splitting at the width of the grid

Remove the multiplier in grid_create, make it increments of the margin

Do math substitution at neighbors I thought you took 3 years of Calc
Change the definition of min and max cell x and y using increments

Make the color fetcher break once it gets the output (with a return function outside of the else)

Update grid goes to render grid, have display flip at the end
